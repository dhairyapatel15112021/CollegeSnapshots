-> learning for Improvement from Project :
    1) Make a Proper Design Before Development ,
    2) After making this project i feels like i should explore vmax , vmin for font sizing.
    3) If we want handle an error and want to custom Error Page then we have to think it from ealry stage otherwise it will 
        little bit hard to do in the end.
    4) Margin - Padding from each side should be identical.

-> Takeaway OR learning from Project says by AI: 
    1) Consistent Class Naming: Ensure consistent naming conventions for classes. For example, 
                                use either camelCase or kebab-case consistently across your stylesheets.
    2) Responsive Design: Consider making your components more responsive for a variety of screen sizes. 
                            You've started adding some responsiveness, but it can be extended further.
    3) Comments: Add comments in your CSS and JSX files to explain complex styles, components, or any critical logic.
    4) Font Size Units: Consider using relative font size units (e.g., em or rem) for better scalability.
    5) CSS Variables: Consider using CSS variables to define reusable values like colors or font sizes.
    6) Nested Routes: Consider using nested routes more extensively, especially if different pages share common layout component.
    7) Error Boundaries: Implement error boundaries to gracefully handle errors in your components.
    8) Modularization: If your project grows, consider further modularizing your components, styles, and assets for easier maintenance.
